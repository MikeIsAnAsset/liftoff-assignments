## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Inspired by the Matthew Mayor Memorial and Robert Elslav Simon Jr., Founder and Father of Reston, VA, the vision is to revolutionize a vulnerable urban community into a creative, dense innovation ecosystem venue that fosters and nourishes next generation innovators.  One block at a time.  Work.  Live.  Play.  Oh, and innovate!

An app will be created to start the conversation and story that engages the community to address these pain points:

- Awareness
- Grassroots engagement
- Talent
- Vacant housing and properties in St. Louis

Through engagement at the grassroots, the app will create a vision of innovation, enabling stakeholders, including youth, to become aware of, and connect to, this vibrant community and existing innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems.  The app will spur inclusive growth, helping to create talent versus finding it.  This will create more buy-in of On-the-Job-Training (OJT) and Apprenticeship programs.  The app will become a blueprint pathway for strengthening economy and the real estate market.
